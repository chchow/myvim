simplefold is a small plugin that improves (for some definition of "improve", see the explanation and screenshots at http://eigenclass.org/hiki/simplefold) on other folding methods (syntax, marker, indent, expr). It was originally written for Ruby, but now also supports Objective Caml, PHP, Perl and Java. It features:
* optimized vertical space usage
* sensible foldtext
* top-level folds: one per interesting definition. No need to open a class fold to see which methods it contains. Get a quick overview of the classes/methods/functions (whatever applies in the current filetype) with zM.
* optional nested folds for if/while and so on
* easy to adapt to other filetypes; just by setting 2-3 regexps

Usage
---------
Use <Leader>f (by default \f) to fold.

You can also use 
 :Fold UNQUOTED-REGEXP

to create folds showing the lines matching the given regexp, leaving everything else hidden; e.g.

 :Fold \vfoo(bar|baz)

will create folds starting at each line matching foo(bar|baz), so that these are the only lines you see in your buffer (it's effectively a sort of internal grep).
